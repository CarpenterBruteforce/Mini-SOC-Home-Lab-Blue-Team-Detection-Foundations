# Mini-SOC-Home-Lab-Blue-Team-Detection-Foundations
This repository documents the design and implementation of a personal Mini Security Operations Center (SOC) built in an isolated virtualized environment.  The goal of this project is to gain hands-on SOC L1/L2 experience by setting up log collection, monitoring, alerting, and basic incident response workflows using realistic attack simulations.
